== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=Where is the Lookery Analytics code displayed?=

The Lookery Analytics code is added to the <head> section of your theme by default. It should be somewhere near the bottom of that section.

=Why don't I see the Lookery Analytics code on my website?=

If you have switched off admin logging, you will not see the code. You can try enabling it temporarily or log out of your WordPress account to see if the code is displaying.
